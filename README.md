# mysql_udemycrashcourse
contains all code for challenges I did during the udemy mysql crash course

This repository is for learning github and documenting my work during the course.
It is also partially building my portfolio.
All lines in the code files are commented, beacuse I'd run the same file multiple times
during a challenge, and only commit all the code for a challenge in one file
